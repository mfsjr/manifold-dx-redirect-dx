# React Router Integration for manifold-dx:  RedirectDx

This library provides a manifold-dx state-based mechanism for routing within an application that uses
React Router, specifically its `<Redirect>` component.  NOTE: we are assuming one RedirectDx per application!

Some advantages to using this library with manifold-dx are:
1. Redirects can be done consistently throughout your app using a single line of code, by creating 
   and dispatching an action, e.g.:
  ```typescript jsx
  getActionCreator(this.appState).set('redirectTo', 'search').dispatch();
  ```
  Note that this means that you've defined appState to have a string property called 'redirectTo' 
  that holds the state that will tell React Router where to go.  The appState is a manifold-dx 
  StateObject, with a 'redirectTo' property which are assigned to the RedirectDxProps, like so:
  ```typescript jsx
  <AppRedirectDx redirectDxState={this.appState} redirectDxProp={'redirectTo'} />
  ```
2. URL changes are integrated into manifold-dx actions, so that action undo/redo will 
   move forward and backward across app URL's as well.
3. Deep linking is unaffected, since this library doesn't do anything until after the app is loaded.

To use this in your application, you need to subclass RedirectDx, handing it your state store and 
interface descibing your app state.  For example, if you export its Store as `appStore` and defines 
its state as `AppState`, this is how you would subclass RedirectDx for your app:

```typescript jsx
export class AppRedirectDx<S extends StateObject> extends RedirectDx<S, AppState> {
  constructor(props: RedirectDxProps<S>) {
    super(props, appStore.getState(), undefined, WithRouterRedirectDx); 
  }
}
```

Note that the above snippet has been updated from an older way of doing the same thing.  The React
Team **deprecated** the React.createFactory method.  The old, deprecated style is given below,
while the fixed updated version is given above.

```typescript jsx
export class AppRedirectDx<S extends StateObject> extends RedirectDx<S, AppState> {
  constructor(props: RedirectDxProps<S>) {
    super(props, appStore.getState(), factory);  
  }
}
```

## This project is based off of the TypeScript Library Starter

A starter project that makes creating a TypeScript library extremely easy.  See
https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter

### Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter.git YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME

# Run npm install and write your library name when asked. That's all!
npm install
```

**Start coding!** `package.json` and entry files are already set up for you, so don't worry about linking to your main file, typings, etc. Just keep those files with the same name.

### Features

 - Zero-setup. After running `npm install` things will setup for you :wink:
 - **[RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/)** for multiple optimized bundles following the [standard convention](http://2ality.com/2017/04/setting-up-multi-platform-packages.html) and [Tree-shaking](https://alexjoverm.github.io/2017/03/06/Tree-shaking-with-Webpack-2-TypeScript-and-Babel/)
 - Tests, coverage and interactive watch mode using **[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)**
 - **[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)** and **[TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)** for code formatting and consistency
 - **Docs automatic generation and deployment** to `gh-pages`, using **[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)**
 - Automatic types `(*.d.ts)` file generation
 - **[Travis](https://travis-ci.org)** integration and **[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/)** report
 - (Optional) **Automatic releases and changelog**, using [Semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), [Conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) (for the git hooks)

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something'
```

### NPM scripts

 - `npm t`: Run test suite
 - `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
 - `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
 - `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
 - `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
 - `npm run lint`: Lints code
 - `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

### Automatic releases

_**Prerequisites**: you need to create/login accounts and add your project to:_
 - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
 - [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)
 - [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

_**Prerequisite for Windows**: Semantic-release uses
**[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)** so you will need to
install
[Microsoft's windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools)
using this command:_

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```

#### Setup steps

Follow the console instructions to install semantic release and run it (answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?").

_Note: make sure you've setup `repository.url` in your `package.json` file_

```bash
npm install -g semantic-release-cli
semantic-release-cli setup
# IMPORTANT!! Answer NO to "Do you want a `.travis.yml` file with semantic-release setup?" question. It is already prepared for you :P
```

From now on, you'll need to use `npm run commit`, which is a convenient way to create conventional commits.

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes your code automatically on [github](https://github.com/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), plus generates automatically a changelog. This setup is highly influenced by [Kent C. Dodds course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

### Git Hooks

There is already set a `precommit` hook for formatting your code with Prettier :nail_care:

By default, there are two disabled git hooks. They're set up when you run the `npm run semantic-release-prepare` script. They make sure:
 - You follow a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
 - Your build is not going to fail in [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) (or your CI server), since it's runned locally before `git push`

This makes more sense in combination with [automatic releases](#automatic-releases)

### FAQ

#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```

#### What is `npm install` doing on first run?

It runs the script `tools/init` which sets up everything for you. In short, it:
 - Configures RollupJS for the build, which creates the bundles
 - Configures `package.json` (typings file, main file, etc)
 - Renames main src and test files

#### What if I don't want git-hooks, automatic releases or semantic-release?

Then you may want to:
 - Remove `commitmsg`, `postinstall` scripts from `package.json`. That will not use those git hooks to make sure you make a conventional commit
 - Remove `npm run semantic-release` from `.travis.yml`

#### What if I don't want to use coveralls or report my coverage?

Remove `npm run report-coverage` from `.travis.yml`
